# Overview

This project is for a part of the SEG2105 Course at the University of Ottawa. It is a tribute to one of Dieter Rams' most iconic designs, the ET66 calculator (which is an iteration of the 1980 ET55).

By the start of the 1980's calculators were common household products. Upon the release of the ET55, Braun's calculator design stood apart for its approachability, aesthetic and simplicity.

While it is currently possible to buy a [reissue of the ET66 calculator](https://www.amazon.ca/Braun-BNE001BK-Reissue-Calculator-Black/dp/B00DUDU2Q6), this project is meant to serve as a free software alternative that anyone can use and enjoy.

### 10 Principles for Good Design, [Dieter Rams](https://ifworlddesignguide.com/design-specials/dieter-rams-10-principles-for-good-design):

1. *Good design is innovative*
2. *Good design makes a product useful*
3. *Good design is aesthetic*
4. *Good design makes a product understandable*
5. *Good design is unobtrusive*
6. *Good design is honest*

8. *Good design is thorough down to the last detail*
9. *Good design is environmentally friendly*
10. *Good design is as little design as possible*

# Requirements

   1. The calculator should perform the basic arithmetic operations of an ordinary calculator
   2. The design should closely replicate the Braun ET66
   3. The program should be runnable on Windows, Linux and Mac

# System Architecture
*to be shown here soon*

# How to run
