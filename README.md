This project is part of the SEG2105 Course at the University of Ottawa. It is a tribute to one of Dieter Rams' most iconic designs, the ET66 calculator (which is an iteration of the 1980 ET55).

By the start of the 1980's calculators were becoming common household products. Upon the release of the ET55, Braun's calculator design stood apart for its approachability, aesthetic and simplicity.



*As simple as possible, but not simpler*
